# Fatecode
Hello, here you can find the codes related to our paper (“Fatecode: Fatecode: Cell fate regulator prediction using classification autoencoder perturbation”). Fatecode focuses on cell fate decision making, which is a fundamental process in the development of organisms. This process involves the regulation of gene expression in cells, which ultimately determines the fate of the cell and its role in the organism. I have added comments to each file to make it easier to understand, but if you have any further questions, feel free to contact me. Thank you for your interest in our paper and the accompanying codes.
